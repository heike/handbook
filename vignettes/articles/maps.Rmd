### Maps

The `statesmaps` object consists of polygons and hex shapes describing each state. Additionally, state names, abbreviations and fips codes are provided for linkage with data sources.

```{r maps}
head(statesmaps)
```
As an example to acquire data from the US Census Bureau we can use the code below, thanks to Kyle Walker's amazing [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html) package:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
census_key <- "place your API key here"
#census_api_key(census_key)

# H012001 encodes the average houshold size
hh10 <- get_decennial(geography = "state",
                       variables = "H012001",
                       year = 2010)
map_values <- statesmaps %>% left_join(hh10, by = c("state_name" = "NAME"))
```

Once the data is joined with the mapping information, we can draw choropleth maps or hexbin maps:

```{r}
library(mapproj)
map_values %>% unnest(col=polygon) %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=cut_by_n(value, state_abbv, n=5, type="quantile"))) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "grey50", size=0.1) +
  theme_void () +
  coord_map () +
  scale_fill_nces("Quintiles of\nAverage Household Size", guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE))
```

Note that only in the hexbin diagram we get to see the nation's territory with the smallest average household size: DC residents report in the 2010 census an average household size of 2.1 persons.

```{r}
map_values %>% unnest(col=hexagon) %>%
  filter(piece == 1) %>%  # not necessary, but cleaner
  ggplot(aes( x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=cut_by_n(value, state_abbv, n=5, type="quantile"))) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "grey50", size=0.1) +
  theme_void () +
  coord_map () +
  scale_fill_nces("Quintiles of\nAverage Household Size", guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  geom_text_contrast(aes(label = state_abbv, fill=cut_by_n(value, state_abbv, n=5, type="quantile")), show.legend = FALSE, dark = "gray20",
            map_values %>% filter(piece == 1) %>% unnest(col=hexagon_labels))
```
