# handbook

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the package `handbook` is to provide data for some infrastructure to create graphics. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of handbook like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("heike/handbook")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(handbook)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
